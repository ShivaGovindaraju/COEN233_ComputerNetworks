Assignment 2

Compilation Instructions:
    Change Directories to "Assign2/".
    Ensure that the text-file "Verification_Database.txt" is in the directory with the client.c and server.c files, and that the text-file is organized and filled exactly as described in the problem description document.
    Compile the Client and Server code into executables with the following commands:
        >> gcc client.c -o client
        >> gcc server.c -o server
    Ensure that Port 23456 is available on your machine.
    
Execution Instructions:    
    In one terminal window, start the Server executable within the "Assign1" directory:
        >> ./server
    In a different terminal window, start the Client executable. 
        >> ./client
    The Client will send out a number of data packets to the Server to gain access permission from the network. The five packets that are sent should get the following notices back from the server:
        Test 1 : 4085546805 - Access Granted
        Test 2 : 4086668821 - Not Paid
        Test 3 : 4086808821 - Not Exist, Tech Mis-Match
        Test 4 : 4086674674 - Access Granted
        Test 5 : 4084400332 - Not Exist
    Note that the Server will not stop between tests, and will continue to run ad-infinitum until the user forcibly stops the Server's operation (via 'Ctrl-C' in the terminal).
