Assignment 1

Compilation Instructions:
    Change Directories to "Assign1/".
    Compile the Client and Server code into executables with the following commands:
        >> gcc client.c -o client
        >> gcc server.c -o server
    Ensure that Port 23456 is available on your machine.
    
Execution Instructions:    
    In one terminal window, start the server executable within the "Assign1" directory:
        >> ./server
    In a different terminal window, start the client executable. You must provide the Test Case Number for the specific test case you wish the Client to attempt. Test Case 0 does not test for Error Handling, and will send packets that will pass all error-checks. An example is shown here: 
        >> ./client 0
    Test Case 1 tests for Out-Of-Order Packets.
        >> ./client 1
    Test Case 2 tests for Length Mis-Match.
        >> ./client 2
    Test Case 3 tests for Incorrect End-of-Packet IDs.
        >> ./client 3
    Test Case 4 tests for Duplicate Packets.
        >> ./client 4
    Note that the Server will not stop between tests, and will continue to run ad-infinitum until the user forcibly stops the server's operation (via Ctrl-C in the terminal).
